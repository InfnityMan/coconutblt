# Licensing considerations

This project is an experimental mash-up of ideas inspired by two research repositories:

- Coconut — MIT license (permissive)
- BLT (Byte Latent Transformer) — CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial)

Important notes:
- Code that uses or modifies BLT source files or models distributed under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license must comply with that license, which restricts use to non-commercial purposes.
- You may re-implement ideas (e.g., entropy-based patching, continuous latent reasoning) as original code — implementing the *concepts* is allowed, but reusing BLT's code directly inherits the license.
- When distributing a hybrid project, clearly document which pieces are derived from BLT and ensure the licensing terms are satisfied.

If you have any doubt or plan to use parts of BLT in a commercial setting, consult your legal counsel to confirm compliance.
